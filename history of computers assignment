First Generation: Vacuum Tubes (1940-1956)
The first computer systems used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and were often enormous, taking up entire rooms. These computers were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of electricity, the first computers generated a lot of heat, which was often the cause of malfunctions.
First generation computers relied on machine language, the lowest-level programming language understood by computers, to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time. It would take operators days or even weeks to set-up a new problem. Input was based on punched cards and paper tape, and output was displayed on printouts.
The UNIVAC and ENIAC computers are examples of first-generation computing devices. The UNIVAC was the first commercial computer delivered to a business client, the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951.


The first generation of computer history is generally characterized by the widely used vacuum tubes. A vacuum tube worked similarly to a light bulb and was invented around the same time as a bulb. It made signals stronger; as an amplifier. They acted as switches as well by instigating and stopping the flow of electricity. They also served as magnetic drums for memory. However, these components took up very much space, making the computer very big.
